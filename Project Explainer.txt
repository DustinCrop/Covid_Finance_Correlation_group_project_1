First we will retrieve, using a free API, Bitcoin and QQQ, GLD, SPY, VIX, & TNX prices for the last years. Then, we will calculate the correlation between the stocks  and BTC. Finally, we will conclude the analysis plotting the correlation through a correlation matrix graph.
Since the appearance of Bitcoin, I have always wondered what is the role of Bitcoin in our economy. There are three potential scenarios:
# Does Bitcoin have a similar role than for example Gold? Gold is considered a safe-heaven investment. That is, when the economy is heading into a recession, Gold price tends to move upwards due to investors moving from stocks to Gold. This helps investors to reduce potential losses that a crash in the stock market will bring to their portfolios. If Bitcoin has been playing a safe-heaven role in the investment world, we should expect to get a negative relationship between stock and Bitcoin prices. 
# Another possibility is for Bitcoin to follow the same trend than the markets. That is, if stock prices are rallying, is this positivism contagious, and therefore, also visible in Bitcoin prices?
# A third potential outcome from our analysis may be that Bitcoin prices do not show a relationship with the stock market at all.

In order to get data to carry out our analysis, We used API to retrieve Bitcoin prices. They also have free stock data available but in order to show you two different possibilities to get data.

As a proxy for our market data, we are going to use QQQ, GLD, SPY, VIX, & TNX, these indexes measure the stock performance of large companies listed in the United States, gold, 10 Treasury Note Yield Index and the market volatility.  We will use Pandas DataReader to download SP500 prices and Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) as the source.

Second Side:


Since the emergence of COVID-19, global financial markets have experienced turbulent times. After the markets initially experienced a sharp slump at the beginning of 2020 a rapid (V-shaped) recovery led to new record highs at the end of the year. However, there were also sectors and asset classes whose performance was precisely the opposite. We created a correlation matrix that shows how the prices of various asset classes were affected by COVID-19. We included asset classes such as stocks, resources, futures, and cryptocurrencies. We will use the Pearson Correlation Coefficient. The matrix will measure the correlation between COVID-19 cases and several financial assets such as gold, Bitcoin, and different stocks.

The Pearson correlation coefficient r is a standard measure for quantifying a linear relationship between two variables. In other words, r is a measure of how strongly two continuous variables (for example, price or volume) tend to make similar changes. For the Pearson correlation coefficient to return a meaningful value, the following conditions must be met:

    Both variables x and y are metrically scaled and continuous.
    The relationship between the two variables is approximately linear.
    The two samples of the variables x and y are independent of each other.

1.1 Load Historic COVID-19 Data

We begin by downloading the COVID-19 data. For this purpose, we will use the Statworx API. It provides historical time series data on the number of COVID-19 cases in different countries. In addition, the data contains the number of casualties.

1.2 Loading Data on Selected Financial Assets

We continue by downloading historical price data on different financial assets. For this purpose, we use the Yahoo Finance API. We limit the period to the time after the first documented COVID-19 cases. When you execute the code of this tutorial as it is, you will receive price information for the following financial assets:

Stock Market Indexes

S&P500
DAX
Niki
N225
S&P500 Futures
Stocks: Online Services

Amazon
Netflix
Apple
Google
Microsoft
Stocks: Airlines

Lufthansa Stock

Treasury Bonds Futures

US Treasury Bonds

Next, we will visualize the historical data using line charts.

Next, we will calculate the correlation matrix. Various Python libraries make this an easy task that only requires a few lines of code. We will use the standard math package for this purpose.The matrix shows the Pearson correlation coefficients of all the pairs (X, Y) in our dataset.

# Visualizing the Correlation Matrix in a Heatmap

Heatmaps are an excellent choice for visualizing a correlation matrix. The heatmap applies a color palette to represent numeric values on a scale in different colors. This makes it easier to capture differences and similarities among the correlation coefficients. In Python, we can create heatmaps using the Seaborn package.
